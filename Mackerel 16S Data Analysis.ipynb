    "This parameter is used by Songbird to determine what sample metadata fields should be used as covariates when generating differentials. Here, we generate differentials relative to the `sample_type_body_site` field (using the `sea water` values of this field as a reference), but there are plenty of other options for fields that could be used here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `--p-min-feature-count`\n",
    "To quote the Songbird documentation: the `--p-min-feature-count` parameter specifies \"[the] minimum number of counts a feature needs for it to be included in the analysis.\" We manually specify this parameter here in order to be consistent (until recently, the default minimum feature count [was slightly different](https://github.com/biocore/songbird/issues/62) between the QIIME 2 and standalone Songbird versions).\n",
    "\n",
    "(Also: since we already filtered samples with less than 1,362 total sequences out of the table, Songbird's default `--p-min-sample-count` of `1000` shouldn't do anything here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `--p-epochs`, `--p-learning-rate`, `--p-batch-size`\n",
    "These parameters influence the number of iterations Songbird performs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We've increased `--p-epochs` from the default of 1,000 to 5,000 to make Songbird run for a bit longer (we're working with a fairly large dataset).\n",
    "- We've decreased `--p-learning-rate` from the default of 0.001 to 0.0001 to similarly increase Songbird's run time.\n",
    "- We've increased `--p-batch-size` from the default of 5 to 10 to make Songbird process a larger amount of samples at once in each iteration. Since our samples fall into six \"categories\" (the five mackerel body sites, plus sea water samples), using a larger batch size (that stands a better chance of reflecting this diversity) makes sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `--p-num-random-test-examples`\n",
    "Quoting Songbird's documentation again, this is \"[the number] of random samples to hold out for cross-validation if `training-column` is not specified.\" The default for this is 5 (i.e. use just 5 samples for cross-validation); since we have the luxury of having a lot of samples in this dataset, we can afford to hold out more samples. This is why we've increased this to 50 samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `--p-summary-interval`\n",
    "This just influences how Songbird reports fitting statistics to Tensorboard (which lets us diagnose if Songbird's model is fitting reasonably to the dataset). Again, see [Songbird's FAQ](https://github.com/biocore/songbird#faqs) for details."
